Each group has at least Rover_data and Static_Base_data .xlsx files. Some groups also have a Walking_Rover_data .xlsx file.

A GPS Folder includes all coordinates for the rover stations on August 29-September 1; except for Group I where the coordinates are for the walking rover.

I have included a preliminary figure to demonstrate the trend of the NW-SE dykes and the effect of vehicles on measurements 
A) Uncorrected Total Magnetic Field and B) Semi-correct Residual Magnetic Field. Note that the semi-corrected field has included 
dirunal, IGRF, and some line-to-line / anthropegenic artefacts (more correction will be completed to accomplish a final grid).

Recommended data processing and interpretation: 
1. Time sync the base station data with either rover or walking rover data. Sampling rates: Base station - 3 sec; Rover - Variable; 
Walking rover - 1 sec. Since they are different sampling rates, you may have to interpolate the base station data to link with Rover 
data. Note that some group's base stations shut down prematurely due to battery. In this case, use an extrapolation if necessary.

2. Complete a diurnal correction on the Rover and Walking Rover data. This was discussed in the field.

3. Plot the residual magnetic field profiles along seperate lines (i.e. N-S, E-W, culvert). Use GPS coordinates or UTC to 
determine line breaks easily. Please ensure the profiles are fully annotated.

4. Each group should have at least one positive amplitude anomaly associated with the dyke. Please complete a standard 
full width at half maximum calcuation to estimate depth of one dyke (e.g. Table 3.2 in Prem V. Sharma, 1997).
